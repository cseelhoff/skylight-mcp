MCP server for [Skylight Calendar](https://www.ourskylight.com) — 114 tools across calendar events (read+write), shared lists (read+write), chores and rewards (read+write), task-box items (read+write), meals (read+write), AI auto-creation (meal-plan + activity-idea generators with draft review/approve), messages and albums (read+write), photo/video upload, and frame/device/account settings + calendar + member management (read+write, incl. preset and custom-photo avatars).

Every API request carries the `skylight-api-version: 2026-05-01` header (matching the official mobile app); without it some features 422 with "API version does not support …".

## MCP protocol support

The server uses the official TypeScript SDK v2 and supports the stateless `2026-07-28` protocol revision over stdio. Clients can discover and call tools without an initialization handshake. Existing clients can still use the `2025-11-25` handshake.

The default transport is stdio, which opens no network listener. Passing `--http` serves Streamable HTTP instead, for remote clients. See [Remote HTTP](#remote-http).

## Auth

The server uses a headless email+password OAuth2 authorization-code flow — no SSO, no 2FA, no browser extension required. Configure it with `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` if you already hold a token, or `SKYLIGHT_EMAIL` + `SKYLIGHT_PASSWORD` to log in for one.

On first tool call, the server performs four steps against `https://app.ourskylight.com`:
1. `GET /auth/session/new` — fetch the Rails CSRF token and session cookie.
2. `POST /auth/session` — log in with email + password (must happen before OAuth authorize).
3. `GET /oauth/authorize` — send an S256 PKCE `code_challenge` (the server requires it) and receive the one-time authorization code via redirect.
4. `POST /oauth/token` — exchange the code plus the matching `code_verifier` for a bearer `access_token` + `refresh_token` (currently a 24-hour expiry; the client reads the returned `expires_in` rather than assuming).

OAuth redirects stay on the authentication origin. Relative redirects resolve against the current URL. The configured callback supplies the authorization code without receiving a request or session cookie. Unexpected destinations fail without including the redirect URL in the error.

The client then refreshes the token proactively (~60 s before expiry) and reactively on any 401. No bot wall has been observed — the headless flow works directly from Node.

**No env vars → clean start:** if credentials are not set, the server still starts without error. Auth is deferred to the first tool call, so MCP hosts can complete install-time tool listing before credentials are configured.

### Using the auth helpers from your own code

The package also exports Skylight's session login and refresh, so a separate program can authenticate without copying `src/`:

```ts
import { login, refresh } from 'skylight-mcp/auth';

const tokens = await login({
  authBaseUrl: 'https://app.ourskylight.com',
  email: process.env.SKYLIGHT_EMAIL!,
  password: process.env.SKYLIGHT_PASSWORD!,
});
// Skylight rotates refresh tokens: store the one each call returns.
const next = await refresh({ authBaseUrl: 'https://app.ourskylight.com', refreshToken: tokens.refreshToken });
```

This is the only library entry point; everything else in the package is the MCP server. It is ESM-only and ships type declarations.

## Frame model

All data in Skylight is scoped to a *frame* (the family hub device). On first use the client auto-discovers the single frame on the account. If the account has more than one frame, set `SKYLIGHT_FRAME_ID` to the frame ID you want. Every tool that reads frame-scoped data accepts an optional `frameId` arg to override the default.

## Configuration

### Required — one of these two

**A refresh token you already hold** (preferred: scoped, revocable, and it never
touches the rate-limited login endpoint):

```
SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN=your-refresh-token
```

**Or the login pair**, which mints one for you:

```
SKYLIGHT_EMAIL=you@example.com
SKYLIGHT_PASSWORD=your-password
```

Setting both is also valid, and is the most robust configuration: the token is
used first, and if it has expired the login quietly mints a replacement. With a
token alone, an expired token is reported as expired — the server says so
plainly rather than claiming it is unconfigured.

**A supplied refresh token is single-use.** Skylight rotates the refresh token
every time it is spent, so the server's first start uses up
`SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` and keeps working on the rotated one — which lives only
in the [token cache](#token-cache). With a token alone, keep that cache enabled
and writable, and never share one token between two hosts: a start that finds
the env token already spent cannot recover without the login pair.

### Optional

| Env var | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SKYLIGHT_FRAME_ID` | auto-discovered | Force a specific frame when the account has multiple |
| `SKYLIGHT_NAME` | *(none)* | Friendly label used in startup logs |
| `SKYLIGHT_BASE_URL` | `https://app.ourskylight.com/api` | Override the API base URL |
| `SKYLIGHT_APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` | *(none)* | App-specific password (from appleid.apple.com) that `skylight_link_apple_calendar` sends to Skylight. Env-only by design: it is never a tool argument, so it never passes through the model, the transcript or the host's tool-call log |
| `SKYLIGHT_APPLE_ID` | *(none)* | Apple ID email for `skylight_link_apple_calendar`; the tool's `email` argument overrides it |
| `SKYLIGHT_UPLOAD_DIR` | *(none — any path)* | Directories that `skylight_upload_photo`, `skylight_import_events_from_photo` and `skylight_set_member_avatar` may upload from (several separated by `:`, or `;` on Windows; `~` allowed). When set, any other path is refused before the confirmation preview, and the avatar read re-checks it when the file is opened. Unset means no directory restriction (the type, symlink, size and content checks still apply) |

Treat `.env` like a password file — it is gitignored, do not commit it.

### Confirmations

Some writes ask you to confirm before anything happens: uploading a local
photo or avatar; inviting, approving or removing a user; deleting a family
member; linking an Apple calendar; opening the frame to the public; the two
bulk deletes (`skylight_delete_messages`, `skylight_clear_list`), whose preview
lists every item that would go; and meal/chore edits or deletes whose
`apply_to` reaches past the one occurrence named. A client that can show a confirmation prompt (Claude Code) shows one.
Elsewhere the first call makes no change and returns a preview of exactly what
would be sent plus a `confirmToken`; only a repeat call with that token, and
the same arguments, performs it — once.

| variable | default | |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_CONFIRM_MODE` | `ask-user` | What a write does on a client that cannot show a confirmation prompt (claude.ai, Claude Desktop). `ask-user`: two steps — the first call does nothing and returns a preview plus a token, and the model must get your approval in chat before calling again with it. `auto`: the same two steps, but the model may use the token after reviewing the preview itself. `refuse`: writes are refused on such clients. A client that can show prompts (Claude Code) always gets the real prompt. An unrecognised value is treated as `refuse`. |
| `MCP_CONFIRM_TTL_SECONDS` | `600` | How long a token stays valid. |
| `MCP_CONFIRM_SECRET` | random per process | Signing key; set it only if tokens must survive a server restart. |

### Token cache

After the first login the OAuth token pair is cached at
`$MCP_DATA_DIR/.skylight-mcp/tokens.json` (falling back to `$HOME`), written
`0600`. A later start reuses it instead of re-running the four-step login —
which matters because Skylight's login endpoint rate-limits, and a hosted
server that scales to zero cold-starts constantly.

Only the tokens are written; your email and password stay in the environment.
A cached token that has expired is refreshed rather than re-logged-in, and a
refresh token the server rejects falls back to a fresh login, so a stale file
cannot lock you out.

The cache is bound to whichever credential minted it — the password pair, or the
supplied `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN`. Rotate that credential, or point the server at
a different account, and the cached token is discarded rather than kept in play.
Only a salted digest is stored; no email, password or supplied token reaches the
file.

Set `SKYLIGHT_TOKEN_CACHE=false` to turn it off and log in on every start, or
`SKYLIGHT_TOKEN_FILE` to put the cache somewhere specific.

If a write fails (read-only or full data dir) the server logs to stderr and
keeps working on the in-memory token — only the next start pays for it. With
the login pair that cost is one login. With only `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` it is
a lockout, because the rotated token was never saved: the server says so loudly
on stderr, and warns at startup if `SKYLIGHT_TOKEN_CACHE=false` is set without
a login pair.

## Remote HTTP

`node dist/bundle.js --http` serves MCP at `http://127.0.0.1:3000/mcp`. Every request must carry the shared secret from `MCP_HTTP_SECRET`, in one of two forms:

- `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` on `/mcp`
- the secret URL `/mcp/<secret>`, for clients that accept only a URL

Anything else gets a 401. The secret must be at least 32 URL-safe characters (`openssl rand -hex 32`). `MCP_HTTP_PORT` and `MCP_HTTP_HOST` override the port and bind address. The server binds to localhost by default, so put a TLS tunnel or reverse proxy in front of it to publish it:

```
MCP_HTTP_SECRET=$(openssl rand -hex 32) node --env-file=.env dist/bundle.js --http
ngrok http 3000
```

Anyone holding the secret has full access to the account. Treat the secret URL like a password, and rotate the secret if it leaks. The confirmation gates described below still apply.

## Local dev

```
npm install
npm run build
npm test
npm run dev   # requires .env with credentials
```

Tests: vitest, 100% line/branch/function/statement coverage enforced. All tests are mocked — no network calls in CI.
