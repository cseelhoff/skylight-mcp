# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## TL;DR

MCP server for Skylight Calendar — 114 tools across calendar events (read+write), shared lists (read+write), chores and rewards (read+write), task-box items (read+write), meals (read+write), AI auto-creation (meal-plan + activity-idea generators with draft review/approve), messages and albums (read+write), photo/video upload, and frame/device/account settings + calendar + member/category management (read+write, incl. preset and custom-photo avatars).

Every request carries the `skylight-api-version: 2026-05-01` header (`src/client.ts`), matching the official mobile app — without it some features 422 with "API version does not support …".

Auth resolution lives in `src/auth.ts`. Two credentials are accepted: a `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` you already hold (skips the login endpoint entirely), or `SKYLIGHT_EMAIL` + `SKYLIGHT_PASSWORD`, which mint one via a headless OAuth2 authorization-code flow (Node-direct). See "Auth resolution" below.

The login is **lazy and cached**: `resolveAuth()` hands `SkylightClient` a bootstrap function rather than tokens, and `TokenManager` runs it only when the on-disk cache (`src/token-store.ts`) has nothing usable. A cached live token costs nothing; a cached expired one costs a refresh; only an empty or unusable cache spends a login. This matters because the login endpoint rate-limits (see the `refreshFn` note below) and a scale-to-zero host makes every start a cold one.

## Auth resolution

`src/auth.ts` prefers a supplied `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` and otherwise runs the headless email+password OAuth2 authorization-code flow below; with both set, a stale token falls back to logging in again. (Skylight rejects `grant_type=password` with `unsupported_grant_type`; no browser-bridge proxy is needed — no observed bot wall.)

The flow `resolveAuth()` → `login()` performs all steps against `https://app.ourskylight.com`:

1. `GET /auth/session/new` — scrape the Rails `authenticity_token`, hold the `_skylight_cloud_session` cookie.
2. `POST /auth/session` (form: authenticity_token, email, password; `Origin`/`Referer` = app.ourskylight.com) — 302 to `/auth/session/success` on success. Login **must** happen before the OAuth authorize step — hitting authorize first poisons the CSRF/session state.
3. `GET /oauth/authorize?client_id=skylight-mobile&response_type=code&scope=everything&redirect_uri=https://ourskylight.com/welcome&code_challenge=…&code_challenge_method=S256` — 302 to `https://ourskylight.com/welcome?code=…`. **PKCE is mandatory**: without `code_challenge` the server answers HTTP 400 "Code challenge is required." and issues no code (verified live 2026-08-31).
4. `POST /oauth/token` (grant_type=authorization_code, client_id=skylight-mobile, scope=everything, code, `code_verifier` matching step 3's challenge, redirect_uri, `skylight_api_client_device_*` device params, source=js-mobile) — returns `{ access_token, refresh_token, expires_in: 86400 (24h, observed 2026-08-31 — it was 604800 when this flow was first captured, so read it from the response, never assume), token_type: Bearer }`.

No bot wall has been observed; the headless flow works directly. The server logs in once per process start, then relies on token refresh.

- `src/auth.ts` — `resolveAuth()`: resolves credentials via `loadAccount()`, runs the authorization-code login, returns a `SkylightClient` ready to make API calls.
- `src/auth-session-login.ts` — `login()`: implements the four-step headless authorization-code flow above, including the mandatory S256 PKCE pair (`createPkcePair()`).
- `src/config.ts` — `loadAccount()`: reads `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN`, `SKYLIGHT_EMAIL`, `SKYLIGHT_PASSWORD`, optional `SKYLIGHT_FRAME_ID`, `SKYLIGHT_NAME`, `SKYLIGHT_BASE_URL` from env. Exposes both `baseUrl` (the `/api` base) and `authBaseUrl` (the origin). Returns an `Account` or throws with an actionable message. A refresh token is a complete config on its own; without one, **both** email and password are required (no partial-config fallthrough). `loadAppleCalendarCredential()` separately reads the optional `SKYLIGHT_APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` + `SKYLIGHT_APPLE_ID` pair that `skylight_link_apple_calendar` sends — env-only by design, never a tool argument (fleet-audit#962, #732).
- `src/client.ts` — `SkylightClient`: accepts a `refreshFn` (POST `/oauth/token` grant_type=refresh_token) for proactive (~60 s before expiry) and reactive (on 401, one retry) token refresh. All API calls are Node-direct. The refresh grant is **LIVE-VERIFIED** (2026-08-31): it returns a new access token, rotates the refresh token, and is unaffected by the PKCE requirement on `/oauth/authorize` — which is why `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` kept working while password login was broken.

**No env vars → clean start:** `resolveAuth()` is called lazily (on first tool invocation). The deferred-config-error pattern lives in `src/get-client.ts` (`makeGetClient`): a `CookieSessionManager` (`@chrischall/mcp-utils/session`) runs `resolveAuth()` once on the first tool call, caches a genuine missing-config error (message carrying `NO_ENV_CONFIG_MARKER` from `src/config.ts`) via `isPermanentError`, and single-flights concurrent first calls. The server starts without error so MCP hosts can list tools before credentials are configured; transient login failures (network/5xx/rate-limit) are not cached and retry on the next call.

## Commands

- `npm test` — vitest, all mocked, no network. Must stay green.
- `npm run test:watch` — vitest watch mode.
- `npx vitest run tests/tools/<name>.test.ts` — run one tool test file.
- `npx vitest run -t '<substring>'` — run one test by name.
- `npm run build` — `tsc` typecheck + esbuild bundle → `dist/bundle.js`.
- `npm run dev` — runs `dist/index.js` with `--env-file=.env` (build first).

`vitest.config.ts` enforces **100% lines/branches/functions/statements** on `src/**` (excluding `src/index.ts`). Coverage gaps fail CI — write the failing test first, then the code.

## Code layout

- `src/auth.ts` — `resolveAuth()`: credentials → authorization-code login → `SkylightClient`.
- `src/auth-session-login.ts` — `login()`: headless four-step authorization-code flow.
- `src/config.ts` — `loadAccount()`: env-var resolution, exposes `baseUrl` and `authBaseUrl`.
- `src/client.ts` — `SkylightClient`: a thin wrapper over the shared `createApiClient` (`@chrischall/mcp-utils`) wired to the fleet `TokenManager` (`/session`). The shared client owns 429-retry, 401 mapping, redacted error formatting, and 204/empty handling; the `TokenManager` owns proactive (~60 s skew) + reactive (401-replay) refresh. Skylight-specific bits: the `skylight-api-version` `baseHeaders` and `resolveFrameId()` frame auto-discovery. Multipart uploads (avatars/photos) go through `RequestOpts.formData`.
- `src/token-store.ts` — `tokenStorePath()` / `createTokenPersistence()`: the on-disk token cache (`$MCP_DATA_DIR/.skylight-mcp/tokens.json`, 0600) built on `createFileStatePersistence` + `resolveStateDir` (`@chrischall/mcp-utils/session`). Returns `null` when `SKYLIGHT_TOKEN_CACHE=false`, which puts `TokenManager` back to in-memory-only; `SKYLIGHT_TOKEN_FILE` overrides the path. Only the token pair is stored — never the email or password. The record is `boundTo` a salted digest of email+password, so rotating either discards the cache rather than leaving a token from the old credentials in play. `reportCacheWriteFailure` logs a failed write to stderr and does NOT throw (the in-memory tokens are valid). With a login pair a lost write costs the next start a login; with ONLY `SKYLIGHT_REFRESH_TOKEN` it is a lockout — the refresh grant rotates the token, so the env token is spent and the rotated one existed only in the failed write — and the message says so (`refreshTokenOnly`). `resolveAuth` likewise warns at startup when a token-only deployment sets `SKYLIGHT_TOKEN_CACHE=false` (fleet-audit#245).
- `src/upload-guard.ts` — `vetUploadFile()`: runs before every photo/avatar upload, preview included. Refuses an extension off the tool's allowlist (extensionless included — that is what `~/.ssh/id_ed25519` looks like), a symlink, a non-regular file, anything over the cap (200 MiB photos/videos, 20 MiB avatars), and a file whose leading bytes do not match its extension (fleet-audit#248). When `SKYLIGHT_UPLOAD_DIR` is set it first refuses any path outside those directories, and returns the roots as `allowedRoots` so the avatar read (`fileBlob`) re-checks at open time (fleet-audit#945). A confirmation alone was not enough: under `MCP_CONFIRM_MODE=auto` nothing forces a human to look at the preview before the token is used.
- `src/get-client.ts` — `makeGetClient()`: the lazy `getClient` factory. Wraps `resolveAuth()` in a `CookieSessionManager` for single-flight first login + permanent-vs-transient (`NO_ENV_CONFIG_MARKER`) caching — see "No env vars → clean start" above.
- `src/index.ts` — entry point. Boots the MCP server via `serveStdio` from the v2 SDK (or `serveHttp` from `src/http.ts` with `--http`) and `createMcpServer` from `@chrischall/mcp-utils`, wires `getClient` from `makeGetClient()`, registers the thirteen tool modules.
- `src/http.ts` — `--http` transport: `loadHttpConfig()` (`MCP_HTTP_SECRET` ≥32 URL-safe chars, `MCP_HTTP_PORT`, `MCP_HTTP_HOST` default `127.0.0.1`), `requireSecret()` (401 unless `Authorization: Bearer <secret>` on `/mcp` or the path `/mcp/<secret>`, constant-time compare), `serveHttp()` (`createMcpHandler` + `toNodeHandler` from `@modelcontextprotocol/node`). Stdio stays the default.
- `src/tools/` — one file per domain: `frames.ts`, `settings.ts`, `calendars.ts`, `members.ts`, `events.ts`, `lists.ts`, `chores.ts`, `rewards.ts`, `meals.ts`, `messages.ts`, `tasks.ts`, `ai.ts`, `photos.ts`, plus `_shared.ts` for `textContent()`, `flattenJsonApi()`, and other helpers. `src/s3-upload.ts` holds the dependency-free SigV4 multipart S3 upload used by `photos.ts`.
- `tests/` — mirrors `src/`. Tool tests are in `tests/tools/<name>.test.ts`.

## JSON:API flattening convention

The Skylight API returns JSON:API envelopes (`{ data: { id, type, attributes, relationships }, ... }` or array). `flattenJsonApi()` in `src/tools/_shared.ts` collapses these to plain objects before returning to the LLM. Nearly all tool handlers call `flattenJsonApi(doc)` on raw API responses.

**Exception — sideloaded relationships.** `flattenJsonApi()` keeps only `attributes` + `id`/`type`; it drops `relationships` and the top-level `included` array, so anything requested via `?include=…` is discarded. That is fine for most endpoints but not for `skylight_list_meals`: a meal sitting's slot (breakfast/lunch/dinner) lives only in its `meal_category` relationship, so flattening it away leaves the caller unable to tell which meal is dinner, with no way to recover the link. `flattenSittings()` in `src/tools/meals.ts` therefore resolves each relationship ref against `included` and inlines the flattened resource under the relationship name, falling back to the bare `{ id, type }` ref when it was not sideloaded. Likewise a chore's assignee lives only in its `category` relationship (and `completed_category` records who did an up-for-grabs chore), so `flattenChores()` in `src/tools/chores.ts` inlines those as `category_id` / `completed_category_id` for `skylight_list_chores` (and as `category_ids` when the ref is an array, so a multi-member chore never reads as unassigned). The `{ id, type }` ref and the relationship-bearing resource shape both live in `_shared.ts` as `ResourceRef` / `RelatedResource`. Reach for the same approach in any future tool where a relationship (sideloaded or not) carries load-bearing data.

## Tool surface

114 tools total. The former monolithic `frames.ts` (24 tools) is now split into four focused modules: `frames.ts` (8 core frame/device/account reads + the device-album write + device rename), `settings.ts` (5 frame-settings writes incl. the global reminder profile), `calendars.ts` (10 calendar + reminder tools), and `members.ts` (10 people/category tools). Counts: 9 frame + 5 settings + 10 calendar + 10 member, 10 event tools (incl. both notification-settings read+write), 12 list tools (2R+10W), 10 chore tools (3R+7W), 7 reward tools (1R+6W), 11 meal tools (4R+7W), 15 message/album tools (3R+12W), 4 task-box tools (1R+3W), 8 AI auto-creation tools (4R+4W), 2 photo tools (`skylight_upload_photo`, `skylight_import_events_from_photo`), and 1 healthcheck.

### Confirm gates

A destructive API tool is confirm-gated when its `apply_to` scope affects MORE
than the occurrence the caller named — not merely because the call is
irreversible. `affectsMultipleOccurrences` (`src/tools/_confirm.ts`) is the
single decision point; `future` / `this_and_future` / `all` gate, `one` /
`this` / an omitted `apply_to` do not.

The rule exists because blast radius, not reversibility, is what a caller
cannot see from the call. `skylight_delete_recipe` destroys the recipe you
named and stays ungated. `skylight_delete_meal` at `apply_to: 'all'` also
reaches occurrences previously split off the series, and `'future'` truncates
the original's `UNTIL` and takes the whole tail — neither is visible in the
arguments. Gating on "is a delete" instead would tax every ordinary delete in
the repo with a second round-trip and still not distinguish these.

Gated today: `skylight_update_meal`, `skylight_delete_meal`,
`skylight_update_chore`, `skylight_delete_chore`. All four also carry
`destructiveHint: true`, which is the separate machine-readable signal a host
uses to decide whether to prompt — the gate does not replace it.

A second, independent rule: **any grant, widening or revocation of access is
gated**, regardless of blast radius — `skylight_invite_user`,
`skylight_approve_user`, `skylight_update_frame` when `open_to_public: true`
(fleet-audit#246), and their mirror image `skylight_remove_user` plus
`skylight_delete_category`, which destroys a family member's record and, unless
`reassign_to_category_id` is given, orphans their chores, reward points and
completion history (fleet-audit#963). `skylight_link_apple_calendar` is gated
on the same rule: it hands Skylight persistent access to an iCloud account's
calendars, which is not the frame's own data (fleet-audit#962). Read tools
return third-party-authored text verbatim (captions, comments, subscribed-feed
event descriptions, AI drafts), so a prompt-injected "invite
helper@attacker.example" or "remove user 4821" is a real path to changing who
sees the family's calendar and photos; the preview names the email/member and
frame so the user sees it before it happens. The three local-file uploads
(`skylight_upload_photo`, `skylight_import_events_from_photo`,
`skylight_set_member_avatar`) are gated too, their preview echoing the vetted
absolute path, mime and size.

A third rule: **a bulk delete whose set the caller did not enumerate is
gated** — `skylight_delete_messages` and `skylight_clear_list`
(fleet-audit#964). Both are irreversible (no trash endpoint; a photo on the
frame may exist nowhere else) and both destroy items the call never showed:
an array of ids, or "everything in list 7". The single-item deletes beside
them stay ungated under the blast-radius rule. An already-empty
`skylight_clear_list` has nothing to confirm and returns `removed: 0` directly.

**Previews name things, not numbers.** A gate whose target is a person or a
set reads it first — the frame's member list, its categories, its messages,
the list's items — on BOTH phases, and puts the labels in the preview and in
the bound body (`{ id, user }`, `{ id, label }`, `{ message_ids, messages }`,
`{ listId, ids, items }`). So the token binds what the id resolves to right
now: an id that maps to someone else by phase 2, or an item added to the list
between the calls, is `DRAFT_CHANGED`, not silently acted on. An id that is
not in the list is still previewed, saying so. `nameSome` caps the
`description` at `PREVIEW_NAMES_MAX` names ("+N more"); `willSend` always has
the full set. For `skylight_link_apple_calendar` the bound body carries a
sha256 fingerprint of the env password, never the password.

**How a gate works.** Every gate goes through `confirmWrite` /
`confirmFileUpload` (`src/tools/_confirm.ts`), thin wrappers over mcp-utils'
`requireConfirmationWithFallback` + `confirmationFromEnv`. A client that can be
prompted gets a real elicitation. One that cannot (claude.ai, Claude Desktop)
gets the two-phase token flow under `MCP_CONFIRM_MODE` (default `ask-user`): the
first call writes nothing and returns `status: "confirmation-required"`, the
preview (`description`, `method`, `path`, `willSend`) and a `confirmToken`;
only a repeat call with that token proceeds. The token binds the tool, the
target id and a hash of `{ method, path, body }`, so a changed argument is
`DRAFT_CHANGED` and a replay is `TOKEN_REUSED`. There is no `confirm` parameter.

### Known unknowns — write payload shapes

Write-tool payload shapes have been partially verified live:

- `skylight_create_event` and `skylight_delete_event` — **live-confirmed**: flat top-level params (e.g. `{ summary, starts_at, ... }`) return 200; the `{ calendar_event: { ... } }` JSON:API wrapper returns 422.
- `skylight_update_event` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: uses `PUT /frames/{f}/calendar_events/{id}` (not PATCH — PATCH did not update); flat body.
- `skylight_create_event` / `skylight_update_event` — both accept an optional `category_ids` array (family-member category ids) to assign the event to members; it flows through the flat body. Matches the Skylight web app's `create_event` payload (`{summary, kind, category_ids, starts_at, ...}`).
- `skylight_create_list` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: requires flat `{ label, color, kind }`. `color` is a hex string (e.g. `#42D792`); `kind` is a strict enum — valid values include `shopping` and `to_do` (others like `checklist` return HTTP 500). Both `color` and `kind` are required.
- `skylight_update_list_item` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: list items carry a `status` field (`pending` default, `completed` = checked), NOT a `checked` field. The tool exposes a friendly `checked` boolean that maps to `status` (`completed`/`pending`). `PATCH` confirmed 200.
- `skylight_update_list` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: `PUT /frames/{f}/lists/{id}` with flat `{ label?, color?, kind? }` renames/recolors/retypes a list.
- `skylight_delete_list` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: `DELETE /frames/{f}/lists/{id}`.
- `skylight_create_chore` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: flat `{ summary, category_id }` body; `category_id` is **required** (422 "Category is required" without it). The field was previously named `name` — that was wrong. Optional fields: `start`, `description`, `reward_points`.
- `skylight_complete_chore` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: `PUT /frames/{f}/chores/{id}/completions` with body `{ status: 'complete' }` returns 200 and flips the chore's `status` to `complete` (`completed_on` becomes today). The old `POST /complete` was 404 and the prior `PATCH /frames/{f}/chores/{id}` was a no-op (status stayed pending).
- `skylight_complete_chore_instance` / `skylight_uncomplete_chore` — **LIVE-VERIFIED** per-occurrence completion of a recurring chore: `PUT /frames/{f}/chores/{id}/completions` with `{ status: 'complete', instance_date }` (status is `complete`, NOT `completed`). `category_id` must be **omitted** for a normally-assigned chore (sending it 422s `"category_id must be blank"`); supply it only for an up-for-grabs/shared chore. Add `instance_time` for a time-of-day routine occurrence. Un-complete an occurrence by passing `instance_date` to `skylight_uncomplete_chore` (`{ status: 'pending', instance_date }`).
- `skylight_uncomplete_chore` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: `PUT /frames/{f}/chores/{id}/completions` with body `{ status: 'pending' }` reopens a completed chore (the reverse of `skylight_complete_chore`).
- `skylight_create_recurring_chore` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: recurring chores + routines are created via `POST /frames/{f}/chores/create_multiple` with the chore object directly (NOT an array, NOT `{chores:[]}`). `recurrence_set` is an **array of `"RRULE:…"` strings** (e.g. `["RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,WE,FR"]`) — this is what flips `recurring:true`. Routines = the same call with `routine:true` (use `BYHOUR` in the RRULE for time-of-day). `up_for_grabs:true` works because of the `skylight-api-version` header. Response is `{ data: [ {chore} ] }` (array). The tool takes a friendly `recurrence` (RRULE without the `RRULE:` prefix) and prepends the prefix.
- `skylight_update_chore` — **series edit is `PUT /frames/{f}/chores/{id}`** with the full chore body (`apply_to` is NOT needed for a whole-series edit; it's only for occurrence-specific ops). The tool now also accepts `recurrence` (RRULE without prefix → `recurrence_set: ["RRULE:…"]`), `start_time`, `recurring_until`, and `emoji_icon`.
- `skylight_delete_chore` — **series-scoped delete**: `DELETE /frames/{f}/chores/{id}?apply_to=one|all` (`one` = just this occurrence, `all` = whole series; omit `apply_to` for a plain delete). Returns HTTP 200 with no body → tool falls back to `{ deleted: id }`.
- `skylight_search_chores` — `GET /frames/{f}/chores/search?search_query=…&include_up_for_grabs=…&limit=…&ended_chore_lookback_days=…` finds unscheduled/template chores the date-range list can't return. Booleans/numbers (incl. `false`/`0`) are passed through; only `undefined` query keys are dropped.
- `skylight_set_list_item_section` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: `PUT /frames/{f}/lists/{id}/list_items/bulk_update_section` with body `{ item_ids, section }` returns 200, moving items into a named section (`section: null` clears it).
- `skylight_clear_list` — **FIXED (live-verified body)**: `bulk_destroy` takes a flat `{ ids: [...] }` body (captured from the mobile app). Now GETs the list-item ids and issues a single `DELETE .../list_items/bulk_destroy { ids }`, returning `{ cleared, removed }` (no DELETE when the list is empty). `skylight_delete_list_items` exposes the same endpoint for bulk-deleting specific items → `{ deleted: n }`.
- `skylight_update_list_item` — also accepts an optional `section` (string or `null` to clear), captured from the mobile list-item update body `{ label, status, section }`.
- `skylight_update_family_member` — **live-verified fields**: `PUT /frames/{f}/categories/{id}/family_member` with `compact({ birthday, dietary_preferences })`. The member's *name* is the category `label` — set it via `skylight_update_category` (NOT here).
- `skylight_update_category` — **live-verified (JSON, not multipart)**: `PUT /frames/{f}/categories/{id}` with `compact({ label, color, linked_to_profile, selected_for_chore_chart, avatar_id })`. Set `linked_to_profile: true` (usually with `selected_for_chore_chart: true`) to convert a basic label into a full family-member profile.
- `skylight_create_reward` — **live-verified fields**: `POST /frames/{f}/rewards` with `compact({ name, description, point_value, respawn_on_redemption, category_ids })`. `respawn_on_redemption: true` lets the reward be redeemed repeatedly.
- `skylight_delete_category` — gained an **inferred** `reassign_to_category_id`: when provided it is sent as the DELETE request body so the member's items move to another category instead of being orphaned. Inferred from the app bundle.
- `skylight_copy_messages_to_frames` — **inferred (from the app bundle, not live-verified)**: `POST /frames/{f}/copy_to_frames` with `{ message_ids, new_frame_ids }` copies photos/messages onto other frames on the account. Returns the JSON:API doc when the server sends one; falls back to `{ copied, new_frame_ids }` on an empty 2xx body.
- `skylight_set_device_album` — **inferred (from bundle)**: `PUT /frames/{f}/devices/{id}` with `{ current_album_id }` sets which photo album a device displays. Other device fields are not yet exposed.
- `skylight_categorize_source_calendar` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: `PUT /frames/{f}/source_calendars/{id}/source_calendar_categorizations` with body `{ categorizations: [{ category_id }, …] }` returns 200, attributing the calendar's events to those family-member categories.
- `skylight_link_apple_calendar` — **not CI-live-verified**: `POST /frames/{f}/calendars/apple` with `{ email, app_specific_password }`. Needs a real Apple ID + app-specific password (generated at appleid.apple.com) to exercise live; the payload shape is unverified. The password is read from `SKYLIGHT_APPLE_APP_PASSWORD` (the Apple ID from the `email` argument or `SKYLIGHT_APPLE_ID`) and is never a tool argument; the write is confirm-gated with the password fingerprinted in the preview, and the flattened response and any upstream error text are scrubbed of it before they reach the client (fleet-audit#962, #732).
- `skylight_create_source_calendar` — generic passthrough: `POST /frames/{f}/source_calendars` with `{ attributes }`. Provider-specific attribute shape is not validated by the tool.
- `skylight_update_meal` / `skylight_delete_meal` — **LIVE-VERIFIED**: meal sittings are NOT create-only. The routes are members one level *below* the sitting: `PATCH`/`DELETE /frames/{f}/meals/sittings/{id}/instances/{YYYY-MM-DD}?apply_to=one|future|all`. Probing the sitting itself (`/meals/sittings/{id}`) or the `/instances` **collection** only ever finds routing 404s — which is why the earlier sweep concluded, wrongly, that they did not exist. `apply_to` is the app-wide recurrence scope (`ScheduledItemUpdateApplyTo`), shared with calendar events: `one` splits that occurrence into a standalone sitting, `future` truncates the series' `UNTIL` and spawns a new independent tail sitting (**not** reachable from the original's `/instances` — re-list the date range or it looks like it vanished), `all` hits the whole series including occurrences previously split off it. Full detail in `docs/MOBILE_API_FINDINGS.md`.
- `skylight_plan_meal` — **LIVE-VERIFIED 422**: `POST /frames/{f}/meals/sittings` rejects `summary` when `meal_recipe_id` is set — `{"errors":{"summary":["must be blank"]}}`. Pass `summary: ""` and the sitting inherits its name from the linked recipe. Whether `PATCH` enforces the same rule is unverified.
- `GET /frames/{f}/meals/sittings/{id}` **404s, but `GET …/{id}/instances` returns the sitting** (200) — that is the single-sitting read. Also: the 404-body discrimination technique (routing 404 vs record 404) needs an explicit `Accept: application/json`, or Rails serves an HTML error page for both and they are indistinguishable.
- `SkylightClient.request()` — **fixed**: now tolerates 2xx responses with an empty body (e.g. chore DELETE returns HTTP 200 with no body). Previously would throw "Unexpected end of JSON input".

When verifying or fixing write tools: run `npm test` to confirm the mock-based tests still pass, then verify against the live API with real credentials and update both the implementation and the tests.

## Conventions

- All tools are `skylight_*`-prefixed.
- **Every API path that interpolates a value is built with the `apiPath` tagged template** (`src/tools/_shared.ts`), never a plain template literal. Ids come from the model, and `fetch` honours `?`, `#` and `../` in the path — an unencoded `id: '123?apply_to=all'` slipped a query past the `skylight_delete_chore` gate (fleet-audit#247). `apiPath` percent-encodes each value into one segment and refuses `.`/`..`/empty; `tests/tools/path-injection.test.ts` fails on any `/…${…}` literal that bypasses it. Query params go through `opts.query`.
- Tool return shape: `minifiedResult(...)` from `@chrischall/mcp-utils` — `{ content: [{ type: 'text', text: JSON.stringify(...) }] }`, one line, no indentation. The pretty-printed two-space form this line used to document is gone: indentation is tokens the caller pays for and never reads. Whitespace *inside* a value (a chore's note, a list item's text) is untouched — only the JSON framing is minified.
- **Tools register with `server.registerTool(name, config, handler)` and every one declares `annotations.readOnlyHint`** — all 113 of them, zero `server.tool(...)`. The migration off the old four-argument `server.tool(name, description, schema, handler)` signature landed as one mechanical pass; before it, the signature had no `annotations` slot, so nothing in this server declared which tools were reads and which were writes, and a host could not tell `skylight_list_events` from `skylight_delete_event` by inspection. The split is **36 reads / 77 writes**: `readOnlyHint: true` means the tool cannot change state on Skylight (it issues GETs only), and anything that creates, updates, deletes, invites, uploads, approves, redeems, marks-complete or sends is `readOnlyHint: false`. Seven writes additionally carry the `destructiveHint: true` they already had. A new tool must declare `readOnlyHint` explicitly; when the answer is genuinely unclear, `false` is the safe direction — `true` on a mutating tool is a false promise to every host that reads annotations.
- **No `view: compact | full` parameter.** The fleet's `view` rung strips image/avatar URLs from an upstream payload. Every read here *is* upstream-verbatim (`textContent(flattenJsonApi(await c.request(...)))`) so the premise holds — and the blocker named on the line above is now gone: `annotations.readOnlyHint` gives "add `view` to the read tools" a machine-checkable definition of *read tool*. What still stops it is that the rule would not pay even if wired: `stripMediaUrls`' key regex is built for camelCase (`photoUrl`, `thumbnailLink`) and Skylight's API is snake_case, so `profile_picture_urls` — the one media field this repo has actually verified (see `tools/members.ts`, "the server pushes it to Cloudinary and fills in `profile_picture_urls`") — is *kept*, not stripped. And the frame's photo tools (`skylight_list_messages`, `skylight_get_message`, `skylight_list_albums`, `skylight_list_avatars`) are tools whose PRODUCT is the image; stripping there empties the response instead of shrinking it. A `src/view.ts` was added by a fleet rollout, wired to nothing, and removed. Revisit with a field projection built from a captured payload — this repo has no fixtures, which is the thing to fix first.
- Write a failing test before implementation (TDD). Tool tests live in `tests/tools/<name>.test.ts` and mock `SkylightClient.request`.
- Auth tests mock `login()` and `refreshFn` at the module boundary — don't paste real cookies or tokens into tests.

## Publishing constraints

The MCP Registry's [server.schema.json](https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-12-11/server.schema.json) caps `server.json`'s `description` at **100 characters**. Values over that fail `mcp-publisher publish` with HTTP 422. Check before committing:

**That cap is on the TOP-LEVEL `description` only** — the 422 names `body.description`, and it is the server's one-line summary. A per-variable description under `packages[].environmentVariables[]` resolves to the schema's `Input.description`, which declares no `maxLength`: the registry currently serves published ones over 300 characters. Do not shorten a variable's help text to satisfy this rule — that trades real documentation for a constraint that does not apply to it.

```bash
jq -r '.description | length' server.json
```

The other description fields (`manifest.json`) have no published length constraint.

## Versioning

Version appears in several places — all must match: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src/index.ts` (the `createMcpServer({ version })` call, annotated with `// x-release-please-version`), `manifest.json`, `server.json`. The `tests/version-sync.test.ts` file asserts this. Don't bump manually unless explicitly asked — versioning is automated via release-please.

## Pull requests & release notes

Fleet policy — Conventional-Commit PR titles, labels, the auto-review /
auto-merge ladder, auto-review follow-up issues, PR timing, and release PRs —
lives in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Don't restate it here; the copies drifted.

Shared technical conventions (publishing, bundling, versioning guards,
write-verification, transport archetypes, testing traps) live in
[`chrischall/workflows`](https://github.com/chrischall/workflows):
`docs/fleet-conventions.md`, plus `README.md` for the CI pipeline contract.

## What to not do

- Don't add a browser-bridge or login-proxy dependency. The headless authorization-code flow works directly — no bot wall has been observed, and per-request proxying is not needed.
- Don't paste real credentials or cookies into tests. Mock `login()` and `SkylightClient.request` at the module boundary.
- Don't break the "no env vars" smoke path. The server must start cleanly with no credentials set — `resolveAuth()` errors are deferred to tool-call time.
- Don't self-merge PRs. Don't add `ready-to-merge` unless the auto-review verdict was `warn`/`fail` and you've explicitly decided to override it (surface the findings to the user first).
